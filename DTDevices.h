/**
 Encrypted Head Voltage encryption algorithm.
 
 <br>The Voltage SecureData Payments consolidated message format is designed to be
 self-contained. The data packet provides all the information necessary to enable decryption
 at the Host SDK. It is also self-describing, meaning that the recipient can reliably
 interpret the contents independent of any other information, even though the specific
 data elements may vary between messages.
 
 <br>The message format is strictly text-based and can be transmitted to the Host even via a web form,
 because the design deliberately avoids characters and character sequences that may otherwise need
 to be escaped in such environments.
 
 <br>The message structure borrows concepts from swipe card Track data specifications,
 specifically the use of start and end sentinels, together with an internal field
 separator that delimit the contents. These delimiters, particularly the field separator
 (|) and end sentinel (~), have been chosen to avoid any possible conflict with
 ciphertext values that may be generated using any version of the Voltage
 SecureData Payments encryption protocols.
 
 <br>The message structure allows for all currently supported card data element types
 (PAN, MID, and Tracks 1, 2 and 3), included in any combination. It is highly flexible,
 allowing for additional data elements to be incorporated, or for substantially new
 formats defined for future use.
 
 The packet looks like:
 _a[FLAGS]|[PAN]|[MID]|[TRACK1]|[TRACK2]|[TRACK3]|[EXP]|[APP]|[ETB]~

 Fields:
 <table>
 <tr><td>"_"</td><td>Start Sentinel (1 char)</td><td>Start of message is always indicated by an underscore.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>"a"</td><td>Format Version (1 char)</td><td>Single letter is used to identify the format version.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>"nn"</td><td>Header (2 chars hex)</td><td>The header indicates which optional data fields, of those defined in this format version, are included in the message. This comprises two hex digits interpreted as explained in the next section.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>"|"</td><td>Field Separator (1 char)</td><td>Vertical pipe is used as a field separator between message elements. A separator is required following the header to allow this to be of variable length.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>"Data(1)"</td><td>First Encrypted Data Field (variable)</td><td>One or more encrypted data fields are optionally included in the sequence defined for the format version.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>"|"</td><td>Field Separator (1 char)</td><td></td></tr>
 <tr><td>"Data(2)"</td><td>Second Encrypted Data Field (variable)</td><td></td></tr>
 <tr><td>"|"</td><td>Field Separator (1 char)</td><td></td></tr>
 <tr><td>...</td></tr>
 <tr><td>"|"</td><td>Field Separator (1 char)</td><td></td></tr>
 <tr><td>"Base46"</td><td>Base64-Encoded ETB (variable)</td><td>he Encryption Transmission Block must be Base64-Encoded prior to inclusion in the message.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>"~"</td><td>End Sentinel (1 char)</td><td>The end of the ETB is always indicated by a tilde character</td></tr>
 </table>
 
 <br>Encrypted card data elements always appear in the message in a defined sequence,
 starting with PAN, MID, Track 1, and the rest. The relative position of these fields,
 delimited by field separators is always fixed although any combination of values is
 legal. Unused fields are omitted together with their terminating separator. The ciphertext
 format may vary depending on the encryption algorithm used. For example, Tracks 1 and 2
 may use whole-track encryption (TEP1) or structure-preserving encryption (TEP2). Elements
 can miss from the packet, i.e. if Track 3 was not read, then it will not be in the packet
 and [FLAGS] will have TR3 bit cleared(0).

 <br>Data Fields and Headers:
 <table>
 <tr><td>"1"</td><td>PAN</td><td>Primary Account Number</td></tr>
 <tr><td>"2"</td><td>MID</td><td>Merchant ID</td></tr>
 <tr><td>"3"</td><td>TR1</td><td>Track 1 data (IATA)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>"4"</td><td>TR2</td><td>Track 2 data (ABA)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>"5"</td><td>TR3</td><td>Track 3 data (THRIFT-TTS)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>"6"</td><td>EXP</td><td>Card expiration data in the form MMYY</td></tr>
 <tr><td>"7"</td><td>APP</td><td>Reserved for application-specific use (unsupported)</td></tr>
 </table>
 
 <br>The header value comprises two hexadecimal digits that together form an 8 bit
 mask indicating the data fields present in the associated message
 
 <br>FLAGS Bit Mask Value:
 <table>
 <tr><td>"Bit 7 (most significant)"</td><td>APP (unsupported)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>"Bit 6"</td><td>EXP</td></tr>
 <tr><td>"Bit 5"</td><td>TR3</td></tr>
 <tr><td>"Bit 4"</td><td>TR2</td></tr>
 <tr><td>"Bit 3"</td><td>TR1</td></tr>
 <tr><td>"Bit 2"</td><td>MID</td></tr>
 <tr><td>"Bit 1"</td><td>PAN</td></tr>
 <tr><td>"Bit 0 (least significant)"</td><td>ETB</td></tr>

 For AES256, after decryption, the result data will be as follows:
 - Random data (4 bytes)
 - Device identification text (16 ASCII characters, unused bytes are 0)
 - Processed track data in the format: 0xF1 (track1 data), 0xF2 (track2 data) 0xF3 (track3 data). It is possible some of the tracks will be empty, then the identifier will not be present too, for example 0xF1 (track1 data) 0xF3 (track3 data)
 - End of track data (byte 0x00)
 - CRC16 (2 bytes) - the CRC is performed from the start of the encrypted block (the Random Data block) to the end of the track data (including the 0x00 byte).
 The data block is rounded to 16 bytes
 
 In the more secure way, where the decryption key resides in a server only, the card read process will look something like:
 - (User) swipes the card 
 - (iOS program) receives the data via magneticCardEncryptedData and sends to the server
 - (iOS program)[optional] sends current device serial number along with the data received from magneticCardEncryptedData. This can be used for data origin verification
 - (Server) decrypts the data, extracts all the information from the fields
 - (Server)[optional] if the ipod program have sent the device serial number before, the server compares the received serial number with the one that's inside the encrypted block 
 - (Server) checks if the card data is the correct one, i.e. all needed tracks are present, card is the same type as required, etc and sends back notification to the ipod program.

 Provides universal access to all supported devices' functions.
 In order to use one of the supported accessories in your program, several steps have to be performed:
 - Include DTDevices.h and libdtdev.a in your project.
 - Go to Frameworks and add ExternalAccessory framework
 - Edit your program plist file, add new element and select "Supported external accessory protocols" from the list, then add the protocol names of the accessories you want to connect to:
 <br>For Linea series: com.datecs.linea.pro.msr and com.datecs.linea.pro.bar
 <br>For Pinpad: com.datecs.iserial.communication and com.datecs.ppad

 <br>For ESC/POS printers: com.datecs.printer.escpos
 
 <br>Since this SDK is based on features, the specific device is not that important, for example, if your program relies on barcode scanning, then Linea, Pinpad or the ESC/POS printers can provide that functionality, so you can include all their protocols.

/**
 Enables or disables Lines's capability to charge the handheld from it's own battery. Charging can stop if connected device's battery goes too low.
 
 <br>While Linea can act as external battery for the iPod/iPhone, there are certain limitations if you decide to implement it. The internal battery is not big enough, so if the iPod/iPhone consumes a lot of power from it, it will go down very fast and force the firmware to cut the charge to prevent going down to dangerous levels. The proper use of this charging function depends on how the program, running on the iPod/iPhone, is used and how the iPod/iPhone is discharged
 
 <br>There are two possible ways to use Linea's charge:
 - Emergency mode - in the case iPod/iPhone usage is designed in a way it will last long enough between charging sessions and using Linea's charge is not generally needed, the charge can be used if the iPod/iPhone for some reason goes too low (like <50%), so it is given some power to continue working until next charging. An example will be store, where devices are being charged every night, but extreme usage on some iPod drains the battery before the end of the shift.
 This is the less efficient way to charge it, also, Linea will refuse to start the charge if it's own battery goes below 3.8v, so depending on the usage, barcode type it may not be possible to start the charge.
 
 - Max life mode - it is the case where both devices are required to operate as long as possible. Usually, the iPod/iPhone's battery will be drained way faster than Linea's, especially with wifi enabled programs and to keep both devices operating as long as possible, the charging should be desinged in a way so iPod/iPhone is able to use most of Linea's battery. This is possible, if you start charging when iPod/iPhone is almost full - at around 75-80% or higher. This way the iPod will consume small amount of energy, allowing our battery to slowly be used almost fully to charge it.
 
 <br>LibraryDemo application contains sample implementation of max life mode charging.

/** @defgroup G_LNCRYPTO Cryptographic & Security Functions
 Starting from firmware 2.13, Linea provides strong cryptographic support for magnetic card data. The encryption is supported on all Linea devices, from software point of view they are all the same, but provide different levels of hardware/firmware security.
 
 <br>An overview of the security, provided by Linea (see each of the crypto functions for further detail):
 
 <br>Hardware/Firmware:
 
 <br>For magnetic card encryption Linea is using AES256, which is the current industry standard encryption algorithm. The encryption key resides in volatile, battery powered ram inside Linea's cpu (for Linea 1.5 onward) and is being lost if anyone tries to break in the Linea device in order to prevent the key from being stolen. Magnetic card data, along with device serial number and some random bytes (to ensure every packet will be different) are being sent to the iOS program in an encrypted way.
 
 
 <br>Software:
 
 <br>Currently there are 2 types of keys, that can be loaded into Linea:
 - AUTHENTICATION KEY - used for device authentication (for example the program can lock itself to work with very specific Linea device) and encryption of the firmware
 - ENCRYPTION KEY - used for magnetic card data encryption. To use msr encryption, you don't need to set the AUTHENTICATION KEY.
 
 <br>Keys: The keys can be set/changed in two ways:
 
 <br>1. Using plain key data - this method is easy to use, but less secure, as it relies on program running on iPod/iPhone to have the key inside, an attacker could compromise the system and extract the key from device's memory. Call cryptoSetKey to set the keys this way. If there is an existing key of the same type inside Linea, you have to pass it too.
 
 <br>2. Using encrypted key data - this method is harder to implement, but provides better security - the key data, encrypted with old key data is sent from a server in secure environment to the program, running on the iOS, then the program forwards it to the Linea. The program itself have no means to decrypt the data, so an attacker can't possibly extract the key. Refer to cryptoSetKey documentation for more detailed description of the loading process.
 
 <br>The initial loading of the keys should always be done in a secure environment.
 
 <br>Magnetic card encryption:
 
 <br>Once ENCRYPTION KEY is set, all magnetic card data gets encrypted, and is now sent via magneticCardEncryptedData instead. The LineaDemo program contains sample code to decrypt the data block and extract the contents - the serial number and track data.
 
 <br>As with keys, card data can be extracted on the iOS device itself (less secure, the application needs to have the key inside) or be sent to a secure server to be processed.

 <br>Demo program: the sample program now have "Crypto" tab, where key management can be tested:
 
 - New AES 256 key - type in the key you want to set (or change to)
 - Old AES 256 key - type in the previous key, or leave blank if you set the key for the first time
 
 <br>[SET AUTHENTICATION KEY] and [SET ENCRYPTION KEY] buttons allow you to use the key info in the text fields above to set the key.
 
 - Decryption key - type in the key, which the demo program will use to try to decrypt card data. This field should contain the
 ENCRYPTION KEY, or something random, if you want to test failed card data decryption.

 <br>Generally the key loading process, using "Raw" commands, a program on the iOS device and a server which holds the keys will look similar to:
 
 - (iOS program) calls cryptoRawGenerateRandomData to get 16 bytes block of random data and send these to the server
 - (Server) creates byte array of 48 bytes consisting of: [RANDOM DATA: 16 bytes][KEY DATA: 32 bytes]
 - (Server) if there is current encryption key set on the Linea (if you want to change existing key) the server encrypts the 48 bytes block with the OLD key
 - (Server) sends the result data back to the program
 - (iOS program) calls cryptoRawSetKey with KEY_ENCRYPTION and the data it received from the server
 - (Linea) tries to decrypt the key data if there was already key present, then extracts the key, verifies the random data and if everything is okay, sets the key

-(DTVoltageInfo *)voltageGetInfo:(NSError **)error;

/**
 Loads new configuration. The configuration is signed with RSA2048 to prevent unauthorized modification and contains all parameters, needed for the algorithm to work.
 
 The format of the data is series of blocks, following the structure:
 - length of the field (2 bytes, big endian)
 - content of the field (variable, can be missing if the length is 0)
 
 If any field is missing, its length is 0 and content - empty. The final block looks something like:
 <br>[RSA CHECKSUM][LenHi,LenLo][Field0][LenHi,LenLo][Field1][LenHi,LenLo][Field2]...
 
 <br>Based on the position, the fields are as follows:
 
 <table>
 <tr><td>0</td><td>Required</td><td>Configuration version, 4 bytes in big endian format, can be read with voltageGetInfo</td></tr>
 <tr><td>1</td><td>Required</td><td>Identity string, variable length, it is used during ETB generation</td></tr>
 <tr><td>2</td><td>Required</td><td>Public parameters, variable length binary data block, used during ETB generation</td></tr>
 <tr><td>3</td><td>Required</td><td>Encryption type, 1 byte, either 0 for full track encryption or 1 for structure preserving encryption (see below)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>4</td><td>Optional</td><td>Merchant ID string, variable length, zero sized means no MID will be present in the packet (see below)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>5</td><td>Optional</td><td>Key rollover days, 4 bytes in big endian format, 0 or zero-sized length disables the feature (see below)</td></tr>
 <tr><td>6</td><td>Optional</td><td>Key rollover number of transactions, 4 bytes in big endian format, 0 or zero-sized length disables the feature (see below)</td></tr>
 </table>


 <br>Encryption type, it can be either 0 (FULL, whole track) or 1 (SPE, structure preserving).
 They both differ on the way track 1 & 2 data and PAN is encrypted, there is no difference in track 3 and merchant ID.
 
 <br>An example of PAN data encryption using both methods:
 - PAN : 5105105105105100
 - FULL: 5105102433775100
 - SPE : +++++++X0oDMHFSj
 
 <br>An example of track 1 data encryption using both methods:
 - Track1: %B5105105105100^840PUBLIC/JOHN Q^120422212345?
 - FULL  : %B5105103065100^840PUBLIC/JOHN Q^1204222kzKsspG8?
 - SPE   : 9o6OY2VmftqV69ZoYqxZ0cusnnDr1oQtiTIVGDaIQrnbSrHql
 
 <br>An example of track 2 data encryption using both methods:
 - Track2: 5105105105105100=120422212345
 - FULL  : 5105103065100=1204222kzKsspG8
 - SPE   : 3Ep5uEIE1Ov7JEEM1IBRGjgQKGT
 
 <br>For PAN data, VOLTAGE_ENCRYPTION_SPE guarantees the following:
 - The leading 6 digits of the original PAN are maintained in the clear.
 - The trailing 4 digits of the original PAN are maintained in the clear.
 - The middle digits are used for the ciphertext value, which is guaranteed to consist solely of digits.
 - The Luhn check value is preserved so that a PAN with a valid (0) result, creates ciphertext that also checks as valid.
 For non-PAN data, such as MIDs, VOLTAGE_ENCRYPTION_SPE behaves the same way as VOLTAGE_ENCRYPTION_FULL.

 <br>Merchant ID value data length can be from 4 to 23 digits long. The input and output character sets are identical and length is always preserved.
 The following is an example of a MID encryption:
 - Plaintext:  8888881000000000
 - Ciphertext: 1234433247352418
 
 <br>Key rollover conditions will will force a new key generation when any of them triggers. When that happns, all conditions are reset
 to their start values, i.e. if you have set key rollover to 10 days or 100 transactions, if the 100 transactions happen first, then
 the day count is reset to 0.
 
 <br>Generating key is a long process (about 2 minutes), so if a card is swiped during the process, the device will use current key 
 to encrypt and restart generation process. You can query the current state of key generation via voltageGetInfo.
 
 <br>Key rollover days - after the specified number of days elapsed, the key will be regenerated. Using value of 0, or not setting this
 field at all (length of 0) disables it. Key rollover will happen automatically after an year in any case.
 The actual time of key generation will differ each time by a random amount, i.e. if you set days to 1 and generated on 7am today,
 the next generation can happen at 6pm on next day. This is by design in order to disperse key generation requests to lower server load.
 
 <br>Key rollover number of transactions - after specified number of cards read, the key will be regenerated. Using value of 0, or not setting this
 field at all (length of 0) disables it.
 
 @note After changing configuration, be sure to call voltageGenerateNewKey in order for the new settings to take effect!
 @note The preferred way of handling the configuration is to send us the configuration values wanted (encryption type, public parameters, identity string,
 key rollover conditions - days/number of transactions) and we will return the required block. Then the program just checks the current parameters
 version and if different - reloads them.

/** @defgroup G_PPEMV PinPad EMV Kernel
 EMV Level 2 kernel functions, structures and defnitions.
 
 <p><b>Kernel initialisation and version verification</b>
 <br>Firstly the application will have to initialise the library, this will only have to be done once at the unit power up.
 At the same time it will be convenient also to check the version info provided by the kernel to make sure that is the expected one.
 <br>After the initialisation, the first thing to do will be to set all the data items needed to start the transaction, mainly these items
 correspond to configuration issues:
 @image html diagram_a.png
 @image latex diagram_a.eps "Kernel initialisation and version verification" width=15cm
 
 <p><b>Card recognition and ATR validation</b>
 <p>The application will be in charge of detecting the presence of the smart card in the reader using the corresponding firmware function call,
 the application must power on the card also, the kernel is used in this phase to validate the ATR got from the card.
 @image html diagram_b.png
 @image latex diagram_b.eps "Card recognition and ATR validation" width=15cm
 
 <p><b>Application selection & initiation</b>
 <p>Once the card has been powered on and the ATR validated to ensure that is a valid EMV card, the next step is to proceed
 with the application selection and initiation.
 @image html diagram_c.png
 @image latex diagram_c.eps "Application selection & initiation" width=15cm
 
 <p><b>Transaction data processing</b>
 <p>Next the rest of the EMV transaction phases will be completed prior to the transaction decision, this includes:
 
 <br>Card data authentication.
 <br>Restrictions processing.
 <br>Risk control.
 <br>Cardholder verification.
 
 <p>For the card data authentication process the function shEMVAuthentication is called with the amount detection flag set to FALSE
 because it's assumed that the amount was already entered and is available for the application, if that’s not the case if the application
 wants to use the actual value for the amount can enable this flag and provide the amount if requested during the dynamic authentication.
 
 <p>If the application is not offline enabled the call to the function shEMVTerminalRisk can be made without setting the data previously
 as shown in the diagam.
 @image html diagram_d.png
 @image latex diagram_d.eps "Data authentication process" width=15cm
 
 <p><b>Application transaction decision</b>
 <br>At this point of the transaction, it's where the first decision is made. All the previous procedures results have been reflected
 on the TVR & TSI, and in this case the former is used to determine what type of transaction will be carried out from here.
 
 <br>Additionally for offline applications it will be necessary to check if the card is in the host list, if so the appropiate TVR bit must be updated.
 
 <br>The “offline possible” verification normally consists of a validation of the transactions log to ensure that the application can store
 the transaction data properly as well as any additional validation such as BIN control.
 
 <br>If the application has online only capabilities the result TRANSACTION_APPROVED should never be received as the response to the
 shEMVMakeTransDecision call, anyhow if this happens the transaction should be considered denied.
 
 <br>Once the cryptogram has been generated, it's necessary to check its type according to the original requested type. So, it's not acceptable
 to get a TC when requesting an AAC or ARQC, for that reason the verification types “AC Requested < XX” appear on the flow diagram.
 @image html diagram_e.png
 @image latex diagram_e.eps "Diagram" width=15cm
 
 <p><b>Transaction card decision</b>
 <br>When the issuer decision is known, it must be informed to the card requesting the appropiate cryptogram type, so that it's the card the one
 who has the final decision regarding the transaction. The refund/reversal procedure is out of the scope of the kernel, anyway all the data items
 needed can be accessed through the shEMVGetDatAsXXXX functions.
 
 <br>Additionally the storage of the scripts results, second cryptogram for further report to the issuer is also out of the scope of this
 specification and will have to be determined by the particular payment system.
 @image html diagram_g.png
 @image latex diagram_g.eps "Diagram" width=15cm
 
 <p><b>Default processing</b>
 <br>If the transaction cannot be completed online due to problems with the communication channel the default processing must be applied.
 In this case, if the application has no offline capabilities the transaction must be declined inmediately without any further processing.

/** @defgroup G_PRNPAGEMODE Printing Page Mode Functions
 Functions to work with the printer's page mode. Page mode is a special operation mode, that allows you to define a virtual page

 and performs some basic graphics operations (draw rectangles, frames, invert parts of the page)
 at any place, rotated or not, then print the result.
 Page mode is useful if you want to create some non-standart printout, or print vertically.
